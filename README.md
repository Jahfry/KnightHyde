This repo contains absolutely no code. It's just a lazy way for me to edit some game tips for the mobile game Knighthood in VSCode with markdown and keep them synced where people can easily access them. 

If you're here because you play Knighthood, keep reading. 

Or if you want to jump straight to the information links, there's this **[Index of Pages](./0-Pages.md)**

If you see something I've written that's wrong or not as good as it could be, feel free to file [an Issue](/KnightHyde/issues). 

## Introduction ... what is this?

This set of information files is for the mobile game 'Knighthood'. 

I go by the name "Hyde" in most online games I play. 

Knighthood + Hyde = KnightHyde. Very original. 

### What is this for?

There's a number of things I would have done differently from the very start if I'd realized how the game changes around level 40. I'm trying to put those down here to help people from "just starting out" to "what the hell is Mythic gear?". 

### Who needs this?

You might "need" these "answers" if you are fairly new to Knighthood. Yep, the game has been around 4 years now. So you old timers? You probably know most of what is here for now (but might still find some good tips). Come back when the level 70 "Atlantica" zone and new Mythic gear progression comes out :)

*If you don't WANT to optimize your time/effort and* ***play casually***, then by all means, play your way. Optimizing a game from the start is never the most FUN way to go about things. But if you're going to endgame it might make fun sooner. 

## Background

### Who TF is Hyde?

An older gamer guy with too much time on my hands. 

I started in Knighthood in Feb 2024 and started this info dump 2 months later. I've only just now hit Karnheim.

* Level 50
* Mythic boots/helmet/sword 
* <> 90% of the way to the Mythic shoulders/legs/arms and maybe 80% toward the Axe and Hammer 
* Acquired the Maverick gauntlet todat
* Just yesterday cleared all 10 floors of the first Onslaught Dungeon
* zero Unique (yellow) heroes or charms so far
* I've just about caught up with the other friends in my guild so we're all still under level 60 without having cleared the end zones

*NOTE: I'm not 100% Free to Play as I have bought around $25 worth of gems and a couple of the better event passes ... but ... I am no whale and will be trying to give tips anyone can accomplish*

## What next?

You read all that? Thanks.
