## What is this?

This repo contains absolutely no code. It's just a lazy way for me to edit some game tips for the mobile game Knighthood in VSCode with markdown and keep them synced where people can easily access them. 

If you're here because you play Knighthood, go here to access the info:

**[Introduction](./00-Intro.md)**

Or if you want to jump straight to the information, there's this:

**[Index of Pages](./0-Pages.md)**

If you see something I've written that's wrong or not as good as it could be, feel free to file [an Issue](/KnightHyde/issues).
