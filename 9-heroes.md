## VIII. Gear

**[Wiki Page](https://knighthood.wiki.gg/wiki/Gauntlets)** (for additional info)

**NOTE:** The Wiki page linked above has a very handy chart that you can sort to compare all gauntlets as well as to see all unlocking requirements. I'm not going to duplicate every gauntlet. 

Additionally you might want to know about [this bug explained on the Wiki](https://knighthood.wiki.gg/wiki/Gauntlets#Extra_Rage_Bug)

Gauntlets, aka "Fist Weapon", are your most important weapon. Which gauntlet you pick depends on:

1. Which gauntlets do you currently have? :)
2. Which of those is has been upgraded the most
3. Which heroes do you want to use most?

Each gauntlet has a different synergy with the heroes you use and, to a lesser degree, the type of enemies you're about to fight. 

I'm not going to cover strategies for every gauntlet below. **Look at each and figure out what is going to make the best combination for you.** Long into the endgame you'll have multiple leveled gauntlets and be able to pick based on the heroes you're about to use, but not as an early player. 

**Once you've gotten your first couple of gauntlets I recommend taking the time to pick one to focus on for a long time**
   * Upgrade it rather than trying to keep multiple gauntlets up to max power
   * Cores will take a lot of farming
   * If you've completely max that rank (blue/purple/yellow) of core in your primary gauntlet
      * If you know which gauntlet you'll want next *AND have it already*, start putting those cores in
      * If you know which gauntlet you'll want next and haven't gotten it yet **but will "soon"**, stockpile the cores, they don't take up inventory
      * If the gauntlet you want next is one of the ones that take ages to acquire ... pretend it doesn't exist for now and pick a new one to start upgrading
      * If you're a fairly new player, Unless you're going to be spending a lot of money, these are the gauntlets you'll have to upgrade by level 40ish:
         * Knight's
         * Champion's
         * Rebel
         * Holy
         * Chaotic
         * Maniacal ... *1,000,000 gold will easily be done by level 40 if you do events/etc*
      * **Zero need to spend gems to get those above**
      * If you are willing to put in a lot of time farming punches, you can get the Maverick gauntlet reasonably early (40ish) with patience and **always punching**. More info on that below. 
      * These gauntlets will take a much longer time:
         * Logician's ... *do as many Onslaught levels per day as you can*
         * Dark ... *get in an active guild ASAP*
         * Lawful ... ***IMPORTANT:*** *gems gained through Subscriptions and other Store purchases* ***DO COUNT*** *to this total*
            * if you are *pondering* buying other gauntlets ($150-$300 per gauntlet), don't buy this one
            * you'll earn it buying the gems for those gauntlets
            * (and no, I didn't buy any gauntlets, and I'm not recommending you do)
         * Valiant ... *fire off all of your Shrine favors every day*
            * Absolute minimum of 200 days to get this gauntlet if you were already have access to Karnheim and use up every favor
            * For a just starting player expect closer to 300 days of doing Shrine Favors ... religiously
               * Shrine resets at the same time as the Daily
               * If you are awake at midnight, fire off 3 in each zone, they'll be finished when you wake up
               * Otherwise do that when you wake up
               * Fire off the remaining 2 favors at dinner time

   **Pro-Tip:** Use the [Knighthood Discord](https://discord.com/invite/knighthood) to get access to the Knighthood Bot

   * This bot is very useful for finding out how close you are to a specific Gauntlet unlock
   * You can talk to the bot in the #bot-commands channel of the Discord
   * You can also send a private Discord message to the bot if you don't want people to see your commands
   * To use the Gauntlet command:
      * Open your Knighthood game
      * Go to "Knight"
      * Go to the "Swap Gauntlet" list
      * Open the screen for the gauntlet in question
      * Take a screenshot ([example screenshot of my Lawful Gauntlet progress](./images/lawful-gauntlet-for-bot.png))
      * In Discord, either in #bot-commands or a private message:
         * Start a message by attaching the screenshot
         * The text for the message should be like  `.g {gauntlet name}`
      * Examples:
         * `.g Lawful` (with screenshot) ... for the Lawful gauntlet like in my link above
         * `.g Maverick` (with screenshot)
         * etc
      * The bot will look at the screenshot and give you an estimate of how many more steps you need to complete that gauntlet
      * (this is only going to be approximate as it is just looking at the % filled on the progress bar)

### A. **Knight's Gauntlet**

* This is your starter gauntlet
* The cores used to upgrade it only work on this gauntlet so feel free to spend them as you get them
* This gauntlet will be your best friend later if you start farming the Maverick Gauntlet (see next)
* Fully maxed the Knight's Gauntlet is the same damage as all of the other gauntlets when you first get them
   * Ie, the Knight's gauntlet will never do as much damage as the other gauntlets when they have even the lowest punch boost upgrade
   * Therefor switch to your first new gauntlet when you get it when you need higher damage

### B. **Maverick Gauntlet**

   I'm skipping most of the gauntlets

   * You'll need to decide which of them is most useful for your style
   * I gave some info at the top on the others
   * The Wiki gives an easy way to compare them all

   The Maverick Gauntlet gets a special section because, while it may not be the best for mid-game, you'll definitely want it later on. And it's actually easier to earn before you get to end game. 

   The reason for this is two-fold:

   1. At lower levels you can use just your Gauntlet and have enough damage for the fights (which also means you don't need to panic to upgrade your other weapon constantly)
   2. Level 30+, when you get to the Mirefen Monster Cave, you'll have access to [Kren Rockjaw](https://knighthood.wiki.gg/wiki/Kren_Rockjaw)

   The reason that lower level (ie, 45 and below) is better to farm Kren in the Monster Caves is because as your Knight levels up their Gauntlet damage goes up each level. *Beyond level 45 even using the Knight's Gauntlet can kill him faster than is optimal.* You can absolutely do this at higher levels, and you'll get a lot of punches while leveling. But if you can get the Maverick Gauntlet earlier without sacrificing anything (except your time and sanity during the Kren farms), all the better. 

   *Kren Rockjaw is the perfect punching bag, his ability is a self-heal that also gives him Protection.* The goal is to get to where he can't kill you, and you can choose to kill him when you want. 

   * When farming punches on Kren, do the highest difficulty that you can keep yourself healed up indefinitely, and punch punch punch
      * If you've completed a difficulty for Kren, **remember you can still pick that lower difficulty if it makes farming more punches easier**
      * Easy-to-get Heroes for Kren:
         * Titania
            * If not at max Stars, that's actually better for Kren, so you don't have to worry about Titania giving you Focus with her base power (which can kill Kren when you don't want to)
            * Base power for Regen/heal
            * Rage power for Protect/heal
         * Wormwood (max stars)
            * base power for Protect (requires max stars)
            * Rage can be useful on adds, but not often
         * Tristan (max stars) ... can take Wormwood's place for base power Protect
         * Once you're more geared you don't really need Protect, but, it's VERY good to *have hero base powers that don't do damage* to help generate Rage and let Kren breath a bit if you're too close to killing him
         * Once you've overgeared Kren significantly, you'll get a bit fewer punches in, but will find a rhythm very easily to keep him alive by using hero powers and a low level weapon
      * Gear
         * At first you'll need whatever gear you have to kill Kren. Don't try farming quite yet. 
         * Eventually you'll be geared up enough and may well need to take a low level weapons for Kren to keep surviving
            * Punch him as much as possible, but don't be afraid to hit him with your level 1 weapon a couple of times if he needs to heal
         * Don't forget your Knight's Gauntlet when you need lower damage to keep Kren up
            * Holy and Rebel Gauntlets are good here if damage isn't too high, as they gets Rage from you using the healing hero powers
            * Champion is also fine, you'll be getting hit plenty
      * **Make use of all 3 rounds to farm punches**
         * You get a total of 60 turns to kill a Monster Cave boss (probably in other areas, too)
         * After turn 60, if the boss is still alive, you lose the match
            * I usually counted each turn in my head
            * Turns 1-30 I try not to bring him down below 50% health (ie, green bar)
               * If he gets that low, start taking it easier on him until he heals, hit with low level weapon, use up your hero base powers
            * Turns 30-45 I let Kren get down to red on the health bar
            * Turns 45-55 I try to keep him just a couple of hits away from death
            * Turn 56+ I kill as quickly as I can
            * *Why not go to turn 60?* ***IMPORTANT:*** The turn counter resets between each round
                * Monster Cave battles have 3 rounds
                * You get 60 turns for each round
                * ***Killing just before that means you get more than 150 turns punching Kren for the cost of a single torch***
      * Alternate method:
         * Some players have used auto-click apps on their phones to automate farming Kren
         * This is something I would normally be all for trying, but, you still have to count turns and take over for the final few turns of a fight if you don't want to waste torches
         * If you prefer to spend 3x torches save your sanity a bit, and can correctly farm Kren (ie, you've balanced your gear/level/heroes to where he can't kill you) ... go for it
