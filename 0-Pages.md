## Index of Pages


These pages form a list of things you should know, both for your own progression as well as for Guild stuff (bosses, wars). The focus is on newer players but there should be good bits in here for most everyone who hasn't completed Karnheim yet. 

The main idea is to help you not waste resources in the early game that you'll want more later.

TLDR; 

There are 4 things to call out even if you're not going to read anything else:

1. If you don't have your Maverick Gauntlet yet, and plan to get it soon, **PUNCH EVERYTHING** (see the Gauntlets page for more info). The grind seems bad, *but it will be worse if you wait until high levels.*
2. If you are low level, buy inventory slots with gems as you get them, you'll want them to stockpile for the Mythic gear grind. *You don't need to max out, but 80-100 slots will fix a lot of later frustration.*
3. If you are higher level (40+) and haven't started ***focusing*** on the Mythic gear grind, start now. It **will** slow down your leveling progression, but your later play will go *much easier*.
4. Figure out which heroes you want to level. Keep your most important heroes levelled up to the level of monsters you are fighting. **Pick a hero class** (Alchemist, Warrior, etc) so when you start working on Charms you can make the most of them.

***IMPORTANT NOTES:*** 
* *I'm not an authority on this stuff, and got a lot from other sources (see "Links/Credits"). If you find something elsewhere that seems better for you, give it a shot. Report back if it works!*
* I'm not making a full-on Wiki resource, because, there's [already a Wiki](https://knighthood.wiki.gg/wiki/Knighthood_Wiki). See the last page "Links/Credits" for additional resources.
