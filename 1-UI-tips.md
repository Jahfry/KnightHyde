## I. KnightHood UI tips (battery, graphics, other UI items)



**A. Settings for graphics/music**

Are you on an older or cheaper phone? I am. 

These are ideas on trying to get the best game performance.

> NOTES:
> * Intructions below are geared to Android. 
> * I use a stock Pixel 5.
> * Brands like Samsung will change the location of some settings, so you'll need to look around. 

* A.1.***Overall FPS improvement:***
  * **Disable sound and music in the game settings**
    * Yes, really, for some reason Knighthood's sound eats a lot of performance. 
    * I leave them off 99% of the time. Don't just turn your phone volume down, disable the sound in game. 
    * If it doesn't feel better, switch it back on if you want sounds. 
* ***If the game JUST STARTED acting "choppy"/sluggish:***
  * **Reboot your phone.** ("have you tried turning it off and on again?")
    * If you don't reboot your phone often, try that first. 
    * *You shouldn't need to do this* ***often***, just not **never**.
  * Make sure other app(s) aren't running in the background that are very busy
  * Clear the app's cache (long press the game launch icon > `app info > Storage & cache > Clear cache` ... **NOT** "Clear storage" )


2. **Battery Saver:**

    This is pretty simple. *You want to play longer.* Try these things and see if you can handle the look of the game. It will be a bit choppier and might look out of focus but you should see a 33-50% longer battery on long sessions. 

    1. Turn on Battery Saver pretty much immediately when you're going to play
    2. Make sure Knighthood is set to Optimized battery (long press the game launch icon > `app info > app battery usage`)
        * Unrestricted is ok but no reason to force that
        * Restricted is ok *if you're not swapping in and out the game often* but is a hassle if you're switching to other apps as it will make the game take longer to work when you switch back to it
    3. Try Extreme Battery Saver (`Settings > Battery > Battery Saver > Extreme Battery Saver`) ... go back to normal battery saver if any apps have problems
    4. In game, turn off music and sound
    5. In game, turn down graphics to low
    6. If your phone has a high refresh display option, turn it off (for my pixel, `Settings > Display > "Smooth Display"`) ... this will help all battery usage but I don't toggle it unless I'm going a long time before next charge as my eyes like the faster refresh
    7. **When done playing for a long while** force-stop the app (long press the game launch icon > `app info (i) > force stop`)

1. B. MAX Performance

This is the *opposite* of trying to save your battery. But it looks and feels much better. This is for when you aren't playing for long or have AC to keep your charge up. 

    * If your phone has a high refresh display, turn it on (Settings > Display > "Smooth Display") ... This won't magically cure low FPS. My phone rarely hits 30 FPS with Knighthood even when charging except in the menus. But having a faster refresh still makes the game feel smoother. 
    * In game, turn graphics to Max (FPS is basically the same between Low / High / Max). This will just make the game a bit sharper over High. But it is **much** sharper than Low. 

    * Pausing to remember your roaming objectives
    * Inventory & Codex
    * "Free" (except for your time) stuff
    * Game Shop 
        * Free Stuff
        * Best buys
        * Worst buys
        * Event passes
    * Shops sometimes hide things
    * Hunting for Minions
