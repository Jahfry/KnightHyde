## I. KnightHood Game UI (in-game menus and tips)

These are some quick tips about things that might not be immediately obvious when playing. 

---

### A. ***Pausing Shows Roaming Monster Objectives***

If you're working on getting all rewards from a Roaming Monster, you might forget what exactly you needed to do. Easy fix: press the top-right of the screen to "pause" and you'll see the list of objectives for that fight. 

---

### B. ***Knight Screen*** (Loadouts, Inventory, Codex, shops, minions, etc)

1. **Loadouts**

   You can have 3 (I wish it was more) presets for swapping your gear. 
   
   **And one of them can auto-apply when someone fights your character in 'PVP' combat.**
   
   *Example:* [This high level character with weak gear](./images/bad%20gear%20for%20pvp%20defense.png) in the Arena (link to an image). They had almost certainly been farming a low level Roaming Monster objective. If they had 'PVP Defense' selected on a loadout, I would have had to fight their strong gear even though they were wearing the weak gear. *While not a big deal in Arena, this would be* ***very bad for a Defender during a Guild War***.

   **To Use Loadouts:**

   * Click the purple and gold star on the top-right of the "Knight" Screen
   * Click one of the 3 slots to edit that preset
   * Things you can set on this screen: *Heroes, Gear and Minions* and ***PVP Defense***
      * If you toggle 'PVP Defense' on, this loadout will be applied when someone fights you in the Arena and **on Guild War maps**
         * Yes, they're really fighting your gear vs. the game's limited AI
         * The game AI doesn't do a great job on hero powers or picking between fist and weapon
         * Pick the heroes that the AI seems to use better (pay attention to which combos are hard for you in the Arena)
   * click "save" (bottom-right) to finish this loadout
   * Repeat for the other 2 loadouts (you can only select 'PVP Defense' on 1 loadout)

   **Now you can quickly 'Apply' from the Loadout screen before a fight,** ***while keeping your PVP defense active***.

   * *This can be useful to keep a "Strong" and a "Weak" loadout, for various roaming monsters* 
   * ***Especially once you have Mythic Rift gear*** *as it does not have the 'Magical', 'Ranged', 'Light', 'Heavy' restistances that lower level roaming monster objectives require*
   * **IMPORTANT:** When you **replace** (not rank up / level up) a piece of gear, especially if you dismantle the old one, fix your loadouts that used that piece of gear. 

   ...

2. **Inventory**

   Want to know how much of a currency you have, but don't want to go to specific locations?
    
   Go to the bottom right `Knight > Inventory tab`

   * *Example:* "how many Arena Crests do I have?" without going to the arena or shops?
   * Even better for currencies that aren't always visible like Laurels and Garlands

   ...

3. **Codex**

   See **all** armor, capes, minions, weapons, but *most importantly:* ***Heroes***. 
   
   *Even if you don't have it?*

    * Example: Not sure which Hero might be a Maverick Alchemist and you don't have any? Codex.
    * Can save a lot of time by not needing to go to a Wiki for the information.
    * Will also show you which ones you do have. 

---

### C. **Merchants** 

   This is purely a tip for seeing things that may not be obvious (I played for weeks before seeing them). 

   **Some** merchants (so far only Guild Merchants) *have more than 1 tab*:

   * **Guild Merchant - Guild Relics**
      * Second tab: *"Communal Relics"*
      * uses the "Laurel" currency, primarily from Guild Wars
      * Ignore it until it matters :)
   * **Guild Merchant - The Quartermaster's Lodge**
      * Second tab: *"Spoils of War"*
      * uses the "Garland" currency, primarily from Guild Wars
      * Sells minion food, scrolls, chests, guild hall ornaments, skins, and a very expensive cape (but that will distill for 262K Gold if you ever have a ton of Garland to waste)

---

### D. **Hunting for Minions** ... no quick way

   Hunting for PVP Arena minions can be a chore. However some Weekly quests will require you to snag 2 of them. The only procedure for checking for them is:

   * Go To > Hunts
   * Click on each hunt (example: Astellan > Guildwood)
   * Look for the "Minion" icon on each difficulty of that hunt you have access to (toggle this from the middle-right of the Hunt's screen)

   Go back to the Hunts list and repeat the above for each hunt until you find a minion. 

   **Yes, this should be shown on the Hunts list, gripe at Midoki.**

---

### E. **"Free" stuff**

There are a few Free things to do regularly in game, some required no time but are a bit hidden:

1. **Hero experience from the Shrine**

   The Shrine is a key to 4 things:

   * Leveling up your Heroes (don't use scrolls)
   * Stocking up on Distills (this is where you put scrolls later on)
   * Obtaining more materials
   * **Eventually** getting the Valiant Gauntlet
      * The Valiant Gauntlet takes 5,000 favors in the Shrine to complete (unless you want to spend over $150 in your money to unlock it)
      * Once you have access to the Karnheim shrine you can complete 25 favors per day
      * **Yes** that's a minimum of ***200 days*** if you complete every favor every day ... so complete as many as you have time and heroes for even if they are max level. 

   **NOTES:**
   * It's a bit weird putting the Shrine here in "Free Stuff" instead of it's own page, but, it really is a daily way to get stuff that requires no stamina and little of your time.
   * If you're going to be playing the game for a bit and need some of your main heroes for playing instead of the Shrine, *just remember to set up your Shrine favors when you're done playing*. 
   * Favors started on one day but not completed until the daily reset will not count against the new day. If it is 11:55pm and you need to fire off a favor to deplete your daily favors, go for it. 

   ...

2. **Mines / Inbox**

   You've surely seen these, but it's good to know that various mines complete at different intervals. 

      * Lower level mines will complete every few hours
      * High level mines may only complete once every 12-24 hours
      * Once a mine has completed a cycle it won't generate more until it has been collected

   If you need the lower level materials, you can increase the passive mine generation by *clearing out your Inbox multiple times per day*.

   **It's not worth it to try and collect from mines on the world map, just use your Inbox.**

   ...

3. **Ads**

   There are 2 types of Advertisement rewards, and they're purely optional:

   * Currency from the main screen (usually rewards 1,000-4000 Gold, but can reward 5-25 gems)
   * Chests in the Vault (green gear/heroes with a **very small** chance for 2 yellow cosmetics)
      * the 2 yellow cosmetics in the Vault Advertisement chest can also drop from Customization chests
      * See the page on [Roaming Monsters](./6-roaming-monsters.md) (later if reading through all pages) for information on why this chest and Customization Chests can be an important source of Gold currency

   **Ads can be a good source for gold** IF you have the patience to watch them. 

   ***Ads can also supremely suck*** when a broken ad is in the mix and you waste your time watching AND can't get the reward. If you see a broken ad more than twice my recommendation is to skip them for a couple of days and try again. I haven't found a way to report broken ads. 

   ...

4. **Free Store Chests**

    The game "Shop" (not merchants) will give you free Gold Chests (normally purchased with Gold) and Gem Chests (purchased with gems). 

    **NOTE:** There's additional Chest information on these pages: ["Chests"](./4-chests.md) and ["Store"](./3-store.md) (but stay on this page for now). 

    * Gold Chests refresh **every 3 hours** (green Gear and Heroes, green and blue Potions, torches and scrolls)
    * Gem Chests refresh **every 2 days** (green/blue/**purple** gear/heroes)

    ***When you see the 'Store' icon jump at the bottom of the main screen, it means a free Chest (or 2) are available.***

       While these usually don't give great rewards, you occasionally get a happy surprise. 
       
       I don't recommend purchasing these chests.
       
       Definitely grab the free ones.
