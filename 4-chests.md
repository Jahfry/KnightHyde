## IV. Chests in KnightHood

**[Wiki Page](https://knighthood.wiki.gg/wiki/Chests)** (for additional info)

These are tips on how to maximize your Chest loot and Gold. 

If you skipped straight here, make sure to also read the [previous page](./3-store.md) as it covers some on purchasing chests from the Store (or rather, why not to). 

**NOTE:** I'm not covering picking Roaming Monsters for their specific Chest loot on this page. But I do go into that on the [Roaming Monsters](./6-roaming.md) page later on. 

For a lot more information on Chests, take a look at [the Knighthood Wiki](https://knighthood.wiki.gg/wiki/Chests), which will tell you the odds on reward rarity.

### A. **When to open a Chest**

Most chests you can open right away with no penalty. However SOME chests give a small buff to -1- Chest when opening in bulk. 

The way this works is you can quickly get the rewards from multiple chests at a time. If it gets to the final reward for the bulk chests and none were of the improved rarity, the last chest guarantees the higher reward (meaning if you got a lucky roll with a higher rarity before the last one ... the last one **does not get the increased rarity bonus**).

* **Customization Chest** ... drops cosmetics (including capes)
   * Open 10 at a time to guarantee -1- will be blue/Epic or higher
   * These are frequently rewards for completing all objectives on the lower level Roaming Monsters
      * They seem to appear as Roaming Monster awards in batches
      * I frequently a couple up at a time and then none again for hours
      * I've seen up to 5 over a 30 minute span of farming Roaming Monsters, often appearing shortly after a previous Customization reward had been killed
      * See the next section on this page for why you might want to farm these in bulk and save them until you have 10 to open
* **Equipment Chest** 
   * Open 10 to guarantee 1 will be blue/Epic
   * You can get these as rewards for favors in the Shrine of Heroes (may only appear on Realm of Fire and Karnheim favors) and Special Events (the ones that run 1 week or 1 month)
   * Merchants sell these, but, all 3 of the currencies used for these shops have MUCH better uses until you have EVERYTHING you need (you'll be wanting tons of Cobalt later on, and there are very good Charms, etc for the same currencies). Therefor I can't recommend these as a source for Equipment chests. 
      * Monster Cave Shop ... 1 from each region for 5 per week
      * Guild Merchants sell 1 per week
      * Arena Shop sells 1 per week
   * You can buy these on the Store, but, yeah, you do you. I wouldn't at least for now. 
* **Deluxe Equipment Chest**
   * Basically the same as the Equipment Chest but with a better chance for purple/Legendary and yellow/Unique rewards (1.2% chance for yellow instead of 0.6% ... **still very low**)
* **Hero Chest**
   * Open 5 for a guaranteed blue/Epic drop
   * Also sold by Merchants and given as rewards for Special Events (which is the only way I get them) or sold through the Store.
   * Since blue/Epic heroes have low Rift power and can't be used in the Dark Onslaught Dungeon ... I generally don't save these up for 5 but that's me not practicing what I preach
   * I have a full section on [Heroes](./9-heroes.md) that goes into ideas for farming shards apart from these chests
* **Deluxe Hero Chest
   * Same as the Hero Chest except higher chance of purple/Legendary and yellow/Unique heroes (again 1.2% vs 0.6%)
* Hero's Challenge Chest
   * Opening 5 gives 5 shards for the yellow/Unique hero
   * These are rare events that run for a week and are not something to think about regularly
* Event Chest
   * Opening 5 gives 5 shards of the yellow/Unique event hero of the event (example: for 'Troll Hunt' you'd get 5 shards of Bayani) as well as 1000 event points
   * If you have the event pass purchased and get to around the 75% completion tier for the event you should get 5 as a reward

### B. **Customization Chests for Gold**

Customization chests are pretty important for farming Gold (which once you're ranking Heroes past rank 3 becomes a roadblock, see [Heroes](./9-heroes.md)). 

The way the Customization Chests provide Gold is:
   * If you don't have the Customization from opening a chest, you collect it, no gold
   * If you already have that Customization, it instantly turns into gold 
      * As little as 625 Gold for green/Rare Ears
      * As much as 328K Gold for yellow/Unique Hair
   * Additionally, Customization Chests drop Capes
      * You can dismantle any Cape for Gold (up to 262K for yellow/Unique) even if you don't have a duplicate
      * You can store duplicates of the same Cape
      * Dismantle the ones you won't wear for Gold when you need it
      * Dismantle the ones you will wear for Gold when you **REALLY** need it
      * ***BUT*** some yellow/Unique Capes are 1-time-only drops
         * Example: the 'Blademaster' award for the first time you hit a specific rank in the Arena
         * Dismantle these only if you won't ever care about it
         * [This Wiki Page](https://knighthood.wiki.gg/wiki/Customization/Cape) has an incomplete list of sources for all Capes, but does a good job of figuring out if a yellow/Unique Cape is a 1-time drop
      * There are other sources for Capes (Merchants, game Store) ... I'll let you find these and decide if they're worth spending on to get Gold. Sometimes they are, especially at high levels when you don't need other stuff from those currencies
