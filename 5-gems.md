## V. Gems

**[Wiki Page: Gems](https://knighthood.wiki.gg/wiki/Gems)** (for additional info)

Gems are a currency that let you play longer, buy things you can't get in game, speed up getting some items, etc. They are earnable in game at a moderate rate. They are also purchasable with real money. 

### A. **Obtaining Gems**

Aside from buying gems with real money, you can earn them in a few ways:

1. **Daily quests** ... probably the most useful source
2. **Mines** ... a passive source that can give you a couple of gems per day. Nothing you can do to speed this up and it doesn't provide many. 
3. **Roaming Monsters** ... occasionally a roaming monster will have gems as a reward. These don't give more than 1-5 gems per, depending on the difficulty of the monster, but if you see them definitely try to get them if you were already going to kill that monster. 
4. **Event Rewards**

This isn't a complete list, just the ones to be most aware of. For a complete list see [the Wiki](https://knighthood.wiki.gg/wiki/Gems)


### B. **Spending Gems**

For the most part gems are a way to speed things up. But there is nothing you can do with gems that you can't do slower without. 

*EXCEPT:*
   **Creating Skins for Morphing** ... this is a purely cosmetic thing. But, you might want the appearance of that yellow/Unique item that you're about to sacrifice for Mythic gear. Remember to craft the skin before you sacrifice if you want it for later. 

Aside from crafting skins, you'll be spending gems on different things depending on your needs. These are places to focus on or avoid:

* A. **Early Game** ... 
   * ***Inventory slots*** are going to be very important for saving up gear for Mythic gear sacrificing later on. 
   * *Stamina* (the blue icon on the bottom-right of most screens that is consumed when doing most combat) to keep fighting stuff if you want to play longer that day
* B. **Mid Game** ... 
   * *Stamina*
   * *Rerolling 'Bounty Board' rewards* (more info for this on the [Roaming Monsters](./6-roaming.md) page). 
   * *Resources* (all kinds) if you're very close to a gear upgrade, but try to farm as much as you can without them
* C. **End Game** ... By this point you'll have a better idea of what you want to spend gems on

There's no chance I'll list EVERY way to spend gems above, but these are the highlights. 

*You can unlock gauntlets with gems.* 
   * up to **20,000 gems per gauntlet** 
      * gem price is different for various gauntlets
      * ***anything that costs 2500 gems or LESS is very easily unlocked for free early on***
      * Additionally the "Maniacal Gauntlet" may sound like it will take awhile but 1,000,000 Gold is earned fairly quickly
   * ***That's $300 in real money.*** More than I could ever recommend.
   * *If you're pondering doing this, might as well do it early on*. 
      * Gauntlets don't get cheaper to unlock with gems. 
      * Example: If you're 90% of the way to unlocking a gauntlet it will still cost you 10,000 gems. 

(I'll cover more about this on the [Gauntlets page](./7-gauntlets.md))
