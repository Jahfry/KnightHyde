## III. KnightHood Store Purchases

These are my opinions. Feel free to ignore. 

If you're a Free player, just go to the [next page](./4-chests.md). 

If you're like me and spend a bit and don't want to waste it, read on:

### **Store Purchases**

   *This is even more opionated than the rest of these pages.*

   **Don't Buy these things** unless you've got more disposable income than I do:

   * **Chests** ... if they say something like "All legendary shards/items will be X hero/gear", that doesn't mean you'll get legendary rewards. I'm not even convinced it means the chances of better gear are better in these chests. The vast majority of your rewards will be bitter disappointment. 
   * **Gold** ... the cost of Gold from the Store is **VERY** high. 
      * Yes, Gold is going to be a major end game roadblock
      * Figure out how else to farm it (see the Roaming Monsters page for info on Customization Chests and monster objective rewards)
      * Figure out which heroes you NEED to level (and avoid leveling bad heroes) to save gold
      * Learn when to Transmute items (and when not to) to save gold
   * **Skins** ... purely cosmetic, nuff said

   *Items to* ***consider*** *buying:*

   * **Gems** ... if you're playing enough that your Daily/Weekly gems are running out, this can be worth it. **I cover how I spend gems [on this page](./5-spending-gems.md).**
      * ***IF you're a brand new player*** ... you will see a deal for $4.99 and $9.99 for a bunch of gems. If you're going to buy gems *buy these*. These new player deals go away. And you don't get to buy them **ever again**. *Yes, this is a casino and these are the "free chips"*, just like the majority of F2P mobile games.
      * **Subscriptions** ... the subscription deals aren't bad. 
         * They don't auto-renew despite the "subscription" name
         * They come in slower than the bigger gem purchases since you get some each day of the subscription (along with a chunk up front) 
         * **Monthly** gives more per money spent than daily (I bought a Monthly during for the last month of grinding to Mythic Rift gear)
         * I believe you can activate both if you're willing to spend $7.50/week or $30/month, but I haven't tried this
      * **Goblet/Pile/Sack/Coffer/Cart/Tower** ... these deliver all gems in a single transaction
         * These are pricey but notice that the $4.99 only gives 270 gems (versus something like 2,000 for the new player deal at $4.99).
         * *Don't buy these unless you are flat out a whale,* ***but they're better than the Gold prices***.
         * **EXCEPT:** In the past the 2 biggest gem deals, Cart and Tower, have gone on sale for 80% off (over a year has gone by, so these deals may not repeat). ***IF you see these*** and are wanting a bunch of gems, *these are the deals to get.*

   * **Event Passes**

      These are a mixed bag. However in certain cases they can be very valuable. **IF you are mid-level or higher** to complete various tiers of the events. 
      
      * I'd suggest not spending on these until you're level 35+. 2 Reasons: 
         1. to make sure you want to keep playing
         2. so that you can accumulate enough points to get better tier rewards. 

   * **Month long events** (Dark Tor, Troll Hunt, etc)
      * The cheap pass is often the most worth it as you can't access the better rewards without the pass. Look at the rewards for the event and decide. **You can buy these towards the end of an event, too, and get the extra rewards on tiers you've already completed.*
      * The expensive pass with event points is only worth it if you NEED the rewards in tiers you won't be able to unlock before the event is over (or if you have more money than time, vs more time than money). *I generally don't recommend these for middle-of-the-road players who spend a little but not a lot.*
      * **Example:** In the 2024 Troll Hunt event (going on as I write this, a couple of weeks left) starting around level 40 and now at level 53 I've got enough gear that I'll be able to get the final 200,000pt reward **without the expensive 2nd pass**, so I bought the cheap pass for the additional rewards (ie, I didn't need to purchase points to complete the event). 
   * **Weekly Events** (primarly Guild Wars)
      * The rewards from Guild Wars can be intensely valuable. 
      * **Example:** the last Guild War gave massive numbers of charms ***IF your guild can control a good portion of the field***. 
         * In those cases *it may well be worth it* since getting charms is a long grind later on. 
         * I estimate I saved thousands of gems worth of stamina points / gear dismantling in the recent war as we got lucky and were matched against inactive small guilds. 

   **NOTE:** I haven't played long enough to have experience with other Store deals that might appear.
